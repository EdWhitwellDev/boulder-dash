You find yourself

in yet another dark

and cold cave.

The tunnels are narrow.

Keys and diamonds

sparkle in the darkness,

but approaching them

requires navigating

through more hazardous

boulders or escaping the

creatures of the cave.

You pick up

the last diamond,

the glowing door

is now within reach,


you can tell you are close.
