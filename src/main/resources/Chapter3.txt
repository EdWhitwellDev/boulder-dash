The next cave is hot,

as if there were lava

moving through the ground.

You carefully test each path,

hoping to uncover safe tiles.

The diamonds and keys you

need are extremely close

to dangerous creatures,

and you will have to push

boulders into position in

order to clear a path.

You finally get the last

diamond, the cave shakes


and a door is revealed.
