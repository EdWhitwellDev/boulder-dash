The next cave

you enter is large,

lit by the radiant,

ancient gem youâ€™ve been looking for.

You collect diamonds and keys

scattered throughout the chamber.

With each pick up,

the attacks from the

creatures become more

aggressive.

When the last item

is collected, the box

to the gem opens. A

hidden escape door

is opened, and you rush

through the tunnels back

to the top


to your escape.
