The adventure starts

when you walk into a number

of natural caves disrupted

by the earthquakes.

You carefully make your way forward,

collecting diamonds buried

within loose dirt and

keys among the rock formations.

The tunnels start showing

signs of collapse -

unstable boulders moving threateningly,

forcing you to time your movements.

Every diamond and key picked

up seems to make the shakes stronger,

increasing the threat of a collapse.

Finally, as you come up with the

last item, the bottom gives way.
